// This does what its name suggests. The given handler is always called, even
// if errors are generated; bus info representations will describe the problem.
//
// The handler is called with an Array of table sections representing today,
// tomorrow and so-on via Dictionaries with string keys "title" (section title)
// and "services". The "services" key tields an Array of one or more bus info
// descriptions (service entries), each itself as a Dictionary with string
// keys as follows:
//
//   "colour"        - Suggested 6-hex-digit RGB colour for the route
//   "number"        - Bus number as a string, e.g. "1", "N/A"
//   "name"          - Service name, e.g. "Island Bay", "No Network Access"
//   "when"          - Due time as a string, e.g. "12:23", "5 mins", "-"
//   "timetablePath" - Path to the MetLink web site timetable for that service,
//                     where known, as a relative path to the stop info URI
//                     base of "https://www.metlink.org.nz/stop/<id>/...".
//
// The handler method is always called from the main thread and is mandatory.

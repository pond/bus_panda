/*
So when I am about to be shown, I need to start an HTTP fetch for the
bus stops around the coordinates in the middle of the view.
 
 I'm going to have to work out how 'wide' an area the "stops nearby" stuff
 from MetLink is based on the initial test population.
 
 Architecturally speaking I just - I guess:
 
 * Stop the system activity indicator on view-to-be-hidden as a precaution
 * Start the system activity indicator
 * Start an HTTP fetch for
https://www.metlink.org.nz/stop/nearbystopdata?lat=-41.289731314547936&lng=174.77500218126283
 * This seems to return a JSON5 top-level array of stop information that
I need to parse into a dictionary per tutorial. Seems pretty close match. Can I find
 the current map view centre anywhere?
 
 * If I have a current HTTP fetch for stops underway I should probably
   cancel it
 * I should probably permanently store stop data and somehow "know" if the
   region I'm viewing has no data in it, but for now could just re-fetch every
   time and repopulate.
